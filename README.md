# Git Scavenger Hunt

Look for items using your basic knowledge of Git/Github. The provided repository holds all the information you'll need to answer the following questions:

1. What is the title of the news story?
2. What changes were made to the news story in a later commit?
3. Which book I am currently reading?
4. Which year I read more books?
5. Have you read any of the books I read in the past years? What is your favorite?
6. Why there are no information about the books in the main branch? Which commit did that happen?
7. How many branches are still active? What is their difference?
8. Which dog picture did you find more cute?
6. What is the tag name for the commit where the readme was changed to how you read now?

Please get as far as you can in answering the questions.
