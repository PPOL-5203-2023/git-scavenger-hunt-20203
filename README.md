# Git Scavenger Hunt

Look for items using your basic knowledge of Git/Github. The provided repository holds all the information you'll need to answer the following questions:

1. What is the title of the news story?
2. What changes were made to the news story in commit (`3a2823824`)?
3. What other Jane Austen novel data was added after Pride and Prejudice?
4. How many dog pictures were initially added to the dog_pictures folder?
5. What was the last change made on the "dogs" branch before it was merged with the "temp"?
6. What is the tag name for the commit where the readme was changed?

Please get as far as you can in answering the questions.
